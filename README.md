This task is oriented to real work with data in JSON format. For the solution we will use the OKVED (All-Russian Classifier of Economic Activities) reference book, which was placed on the web-portal data.gov.ru.

The information you need about the data structure is contained in the file structure.json, and the data itself, which you will need to decode, is contained in the file data.json. The files are located in our repository at github.com.

In order to show that you could actually decode the document you have to write the sum of the global_id fields of all the items encoded in the attached file as a response.
